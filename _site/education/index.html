    <h1>Education</h1>
    <p>
      My younger days were spent attending school at B/ Hindu College, Colombo, Sri Lanka. Like all the kids, most of my time was spent in mischieves, rather than studying. I ended up keeping the scores up and finally finished Ordinary Level (Middle School), and Advanced Level (High School) at the same school.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a second attempt at getting into college, I got admission to the University of Colombo . My first two years were spent in studying Botany, Zoology, Bio Chemistry and Computer Science. Computer Science, and Molecular Biology enticed me equally, and I decided to apply for a Specialization (i.e. Major) in bioinformatics, which seemed to be the natural choice for me.

      After completion of my undergrad Degree, I was offered to teach as Demonstrator (Teaching Assistant) for the lab courses in my home department: Plant Sciences. While working there for an year, I sat for GRE and applied for various colleges for Graduate Studies. After many applications and rejections, I was offered a position to pursue a Master’s Degree in Botany Department at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. I have worked in Liang lab for a period of two years, and have worked on several projects along with my thesis.
    </p>

    <p>
      After Successfully obtaining my Master’s Degree, I am currently reading for my PhD degree in Bioinformatics at Iowa State University. As a second year PhD student I’m currently working for Carolyn Lawrence, and Erik Vollbrecht in a more wet-lab setting.
