abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Previous loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) genetic linkage maps have been based on a variety of {DNA} polymorphisms, such as {AFLPs}, {RAPDs}, {RFLPs}, and {ESTPs}, but only a few {\SSRs} (simple sequence repeats), also known as simple tandem repeats or microsatellites, have been mapped in P. taeda. The objective of this study was to integrate a large set of {\SSR} markers from a variety of sources and published {cDNA} markers into a composite P. taeda genetic map constructed from two reference mapping pedigrees. A dense genetic map that incorporates {\SSR} loci will benefit complete pine genome sequencing, pine population genetics studies, and pine breeding programs. Careful marker annotation using a variety of references further enhances the utility of the integrated {\SSR} map. {RESULTS}: The updated P. taeda genetic map, with an estimated genome coverage of 1,515 {cM}(Kosambi) across 12 linkage groups, incorporated 170 new {\SSR} markers and 290 previously reported {\SSR}, {RFLP}, and {ESTP} markers. The average marker interval was 3.1 {cM}. Of 233 mapped {\SSR} loci, 84 were from {cDNA}-derived sequences ({EST}-{\SSRs}) and 149 were from non-transcribed genomic sequences (genomic-{\SSRs}). Of all 311 mapped {cDNA}-derived markers, 77\% were associated with {NCBI} Pta {UniGene} clusters, 67\% with {RefSeq} proteins, and 62\% with functional Gene Ontology ({GO}) terms. Duplicate (i.e., redundant accessory) and paralogous markers were tentatively identified by evaluating marker sequences by their {UniGene} cluster {IDs}, clone {IDs}, and relative map positions. The average gene diversity, He, among polymorphic {\SSR} loci, including those that were not mapped, was 0.43 for 94 {EST}-{\SSRs} and 0.72 for 83 genomic-{\SSRs}. The genetic map can be viewed and queried at http://www.conifergdb.org/pinemap. {CONCLUSIONS}: Many polymorphic and genetically mapped {\SSR} markers are now available for use in P. taeda population genetics, studies of adaptive traits, and various germplasm management applications. Annotating mapped genes with {UniGene} clusters and {GO} terms allowed assessment of redundant and paralogous {EST} markers and further improved the quality and utility of the genetic map for P. taeda.}

abstract = {The maize W22 inbred has served as a platform for maize genetics since the mid twentieth century. To streamline maize genome analyses, we have sequenced and de novo assembled a W22 reference genome using short-read sequencing technologies. We show that significant structural heterogeneity exists in comparison to the B73 reference genome at multiple scales, from transposon composition and copy number variation to single nucleotide polymorphisms. The generation of this reference genome enables accurate placement of thousands of Mutator (Mu) and Dissociation (Ds) transposable element insertions for reverse and forward genetics studies. Annotation of the genome has been achieved using {RNAseq} analysis, differential nuclease sensitivity profiling, and bisulfite sequencing to fine map open reading frames, open chromatin sites, and {DNA} methylation profiles, respectively. Collectively, the resources developed here integrate W22 as a community reference genome for functional genomics and provide a foundation for the maize pangenome.},

We created a new high‐coverage, robust, and reproducible functional annotation of maize protein‐coding genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) term assignments. Whereas the existing Phytozome and Gramene maize GO annotation sets only cover 41% and 56% of maize protein‐coding genes, respectively, this study provides annotations for 100% of the genes. We also compared the quality of our newly derived annotations with the existing Gramene and Phytozome functional annotation sets by comparing all three to a manually annotated gold standard set of 1,619 genes where annotations were primarily inferred from direct assay or mutant phenotype. Evaluations based on the gold standard indicate that our new annotation set is measurably more accurate than those from Phytozome and Gramene. To derive this new high‐coverage, high‐confidence annotation set, we used sequence similarity and protein domain presence methods as well as mixed‐method pipelines that were developed for the Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Our project to improve maize annotations is called maize‐GAMER (GO Annotation Method, Evaluation, and Review), and the newly derived annotations are accessible via MaizeGDB (<a href="http://download.maizegdb.org/maize-GAMER">http://download.maizegdb.org/maize-GAMER</a>) and CyVerse (B73 RefGen_v3 5b+ at <a href="https://doi.org/10.7946/P2S62P">doi.org/10.7946/P2S62P</a> and B73 RefGen_v4 Zm00001d.2 at <a href="https://doi.org/10.7946/P2M925">doi.org/10.7946/P2M925</a>).

abstract = {{MaizeGDB} is a highly curated, community-oriented database and informatics service to researchers focused on the crop plant and model organism Zea mays ssp. mays. Although some form of the maize community database has existed over the last 25 years, there have only been two major releases. In 1991, the original maize genetics database {MaizeDB} was created. In 2003, the combined contents of {MaizeDB} and the sequence data from {ZmDB} were made accessible as a single resource named {MaizeGDB}. Over the next decade, {MaizeGDB} became more sequence driven while still maintaining traditional maize genetics datasets. This enabled the project to meet the continued growing and evolving needs of the maize research community, yet the interface and underlying infrastructure remained unchanged. In 2015, the {MaizeGDB} team completed a multi-year effort to update the {MaizeGDB} resource by reorganizing existing data, upgrading hardware and infrastructure, creating new tools, incorporating new data types (including diversity data, expression data, gene models, and metabolic pathways), and developing and deploying a modern interface. In addition to coordinating a data resource, the {MaizeGDB} team coordinates activities and provides technical support to the maize research community. {MaizeGDB} is accessible online at http://www.maizegdb.org. \copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2015.

While the evidence suggests only the {TATA} box (canonical and non-canonical {TATA} boxes) as the only core promoter element, it also indicates that the {TATA} box in Chlamydomonas is different than Arabidopsis and human {TATA} boxes. While some proximal promoter elements discovered show weak similarities to known promoter elements from other species, most are novel elements only present in Chlamydomonas. Most of the proximal promoter elements detected show significant similarities to each other. It is evident from this study that the promoter architecture in Chlamydomonas seems to be simpler compared to animals and plants.},
