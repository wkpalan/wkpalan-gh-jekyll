			Mapping, a core concept in bioinformatics, allows us to compare different data types and discover the connections between them. <strong>Bioinformapping</strong> is a broad take on bioinformatics that chronicles practical tools and strategies for data mapping, some I've created myself free for use. If you're anything like me, you were drawn to bioinformatics out of a sense of exploration. Sharing resources is how we keep the journey going.
