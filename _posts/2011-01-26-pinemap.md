A collaborative project to implement <a href="http://gmod.org/wiki/CMap">CMap</a> for <i>Pinus taeda</i> genetic maps.
The generic mapping data generated for <i>P. taeda</i>, before the genome sequence was not available for public consumption.
We used the open source genetic map visualization tool CMap from GMOD, and enabled public visualization of the dataset.
This effort included heavy customization of the CMap code to be able to generate search functions.
