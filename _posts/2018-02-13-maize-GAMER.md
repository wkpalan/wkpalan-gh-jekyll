maize-GAMER is a collaborative project to improve the status of gene functional annotation in maize. The project has three main areas of focus, namely

* Design a pipeline for the functional annotation of maize genes.
* Use manually curated test data to evaluate the annotations and generate a best subset of annotations for use
* Design a user friendly review system for the community to provide feedback and endorsements of the annotations
