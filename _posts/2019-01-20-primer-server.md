**[PrimerServer](https://vollbrechtlab.gdcb.iastate.edu/tools/primer-server/)** is an online tool to design specific primers for complex-genomes. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify specific DNA or RNA moecules for various tasks. Although many tools exist for designing PCR primers, not many tools are available to design specific primers against complex-genomes such as maize and animals. We implemented a easy to use web tool that uses Primer3 to design for a given input sequence and filters out non-specific primers by using BLAST to search against the genome.
